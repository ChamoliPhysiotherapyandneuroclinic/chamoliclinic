          <div class="faq-question" id="spasm">What is Interferential Therapy (ift)?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Interferential current therapy works by sending small amounts of electrical stimulation to damaged tissues in the body. The therapy is meant to boost the body's natural process of responding to pain, by increasing circulation thus producing hormones that promote healing. IFT delivers intermittent pulses to stimulate surface nerves and block the pain signal, by delivering continuous deep stimulation into the affected tissue. IFT relieves pain, increases circulation, decreases edema, and stimulates the muscles. A frequency of 100Hz may stimulate the large diameter A-beta fibers, which have an effect on the pain gate, and inhibit the transmission of small-diameter nociceptive traffic ( C and A-delta fiber), which effectively closes the gait to painful impulses. Interferential current Increases the circulation of blood thus reducing swelling, by washing away the chemicals that stimulate the nociceptive nerve endings. <br>
            A frequency between 1 and 100 Hz is used to contract the normal innervated muscles. Different types of frequencies cause different contractions, a low frequency, causes a twitch, a frequency between 5 and 20 Hz causes a partial tetany contraction and a frequency from 30 to 100 Hz causes a tetanic contraction. IFT also helps to reduce edema 100Hz frequency promotes vasodilation, thus decreasing edema. And a frequency of 10 Hz activates the musculoskeletal pump, used to promote venous and lymphatic return causing a reduction of edema. The neurons that make up the autonomic nervous system, are small and poorly myelinated like the AÎ´ and C fibers of the peripheral nervous system and to stimulate the autonomic nervous system, lower frequencies are utilized to increase the blood flow.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question" id="cause">What Are The Types Of Interferential Therapies?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer"><span><i class="text-highlight">Vector effect</i></span><br>The interference field is rotated to an angle of 450 in each direction, the field thus covers a wider area. This is useful in diffuse pathology or if the site of the lesion cannot be accurately localized. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Frequency swings</i></span><br>Some equipment allows a variation in the speed of the frequency swing. A rhythmic mode may be a continuous swing from 0 to 100 Hz in 5-10s and back in a similar time or it may hold for 1-6s at one frequency followed by 1-6s at another frequency with a variable time to swing between the two. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Constant frequency</i></span><br>Some treatments may be carried out with the interference fixed at a certain frequency. Rhythmic frequency is useful if several types of tissues are to be treated at once. A variation in the frequency also overcomes the problem of tissue accommodation where the response of a particular tissue decreases with time. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Frequency sweep</i></span><br>The principle of using the sweep is that the machine is set to automatically vary the stimulation frequency, it uses either pre-set or user-set sweep ranges. The sweep range should be appropriate to the desired physiological effects. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">The pattern of the sweep makes a significant difference in the stimulation received by the patient. Most machines offer several sweep patterns: <br></i></span><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Triangular sweep pattern.</li>
              <li>Rectangular Sweep Pattern.</li>
              <li>Trapezoidal Sweep Pattern.</li>
            </ul><br>
            In the 'triangular' sweep pattern, the machine gradually changes from the base to the top frequency, for 6 seconds. Although some machines offer 1 or 3-second options.  All frequencies between the base and top frequencies are delivered in equal proportion. <br>
            Rectangular sweep is a different stimulation pattern in which the base and top frequencies are set, but the machine then 'switches' between these two specific frequencies rather than gradually changing from one to the other. <br>
            One will deliver a full range of stimulation frequencies between the set frequency levels and the other will switch from one frequency to the other. The 'trapezoidal' sweep is effectively a combination of these two.

          <div class="faq-answer"><span><i class="text-highlight">The effect of IFT depends upon:</i></span><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Frequency</li>
              <li>Intensity Of current</li>
              <li>Electrode placement</li>
            </ul><br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Frequency</i></span><br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">100-150Hz constant or 90-100Hz rhythmic: </i></span>These frequencies are useful for pain relief, IFT acts on large myelinated fibers in the dorsal horn, blocking off small pain fibers. The higher frequencies have a triggering effect on the endogenous opiates in the mid-brain which inhibit pain.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">0-10Hz rhythmic or 10- 50Hz rhythmic: </i></span>These frequencies are useful for muscle stimulation. They produce stimulation of deep, normally innervated muscle tissue with little sensory stimulation. As the frequency increases the contraction changes from a twitch to a tetanic contraction.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">0-100Hz rhythmic: </i></span>The range of frequencies produces vasodilatation. This is stimulation and relaxation of vessel walls, giving a sinusoidal effect.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Intensity of current</i></span><br>The current is increased till the patient feels tingling, further as accommodation occurs the intensity is increased slowly to the point of muscle stimulation. The duration of treatment varies between 10 - 20 minutes. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Electrode placement</i></span><br>The patient is placed in a comfortable position and the skin is prepared for the treatment. The skin is cleaned, in case of any skin lesion, the area is insulated with petroleum jelly. Vacuum electrodes or pad electrodes are placed accurately at the treatment site and the two pairs of electrodes are positioned so that the crossing point of the two currents is over or within the lesion.

          <div class="faq-question" id="cause">How Does Interferential Therapy (ift) Feel?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Interferential therapy is generally well-tolerated by most individuals. During the session, you may feel a tingling or vibrating sensation at the treatment site. Some people describe it as a gentle, pulsating sensation. The intensity of the sensation can be adjusted by the therapist based on your comfort level.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question" id="sign">How many Sessions Will i Need?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">The number of sessions needed varies depending on the specific condition being treated, its severity, and how well your body responds to the therapy. Some people may experience relief after just a few sessions, while others may require more prolonged treatment. Your therapist will assess your progress and determine the appropriate duration and frequency of sessions based on your individual needs.

          <div class="faq-question" id="measure">Potential Side Effects Of Interferential Therapy</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Interferential therapy is considered safe for most people when administered by trained professionals. However, as with any medical intervention, there are potential side effects and contraindications. Possible side effects may include skin irritation at the electrode sites, mild discomfort during treatment, or rare instances of allergic reactions to electrode pads. It's important to inform your therapist of any pre-existing conditions or concerns you may have to ensure the therapy is suitable for you.
