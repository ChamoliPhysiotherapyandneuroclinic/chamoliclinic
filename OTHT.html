          <div class="faq-question" id="spasm">What is Overhead Track Harness Therapy?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Overhead Track Harness Therapy is a form of Physical therapy that utilizes a ceiling-mounted track system and a harness to assist individuals in performing various exercises and activities. The overhead track allows for controlled movement along a predetermined path, while the harness provides support and safety to the individual undergoing therapy. This approach is commonly used in rehabilitation settings to help patients regain strength, mobility, and balance, particularly those with neurological or musculoskeletal conditions. The therapist can adjust the tension and height of the harness to customize the therapy session according to the patient's needs and progression. Overhead Track Harness Therapy can enhance independence, promote proper movement patterns, and reduce the risk of falls during therapy sessions.

          <div class="faq-question" id="sign">How Is Overhead Track Harness Therapy Implemented?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">An Overhead Track Harness Therapy involves the use of a ceiling-mounted track system combined with a lifting device or sling to safely transfer and move patients within a clinical setting. Here's a general overview of how it's implemented: <br>
            <ol>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Assessment and Planning:</i></span>Before applying the overhead track system to a patient, physiotherapy professionals conduct a thorough assessment of the patient's mobility needs and any specific requirements for transfers. This assessment helps determine the appropriate type and configuration of the overhead track system.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Selection of Lifting Device and Sling:</i></span>Depending on the patient's mobility and transfer requirements, physiotherapy providers select the appropriate lifting device and sling. Common lifting devices include ceiling-mounted patient lifts or portable hoists that attach to the overhead track system. Slings are chosen based on the patient's size, weight, and specific needs for support during transfers.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Attachment of Lifting Device:</i></span>The chosen lifting device is attached to the overhead track system. This may involve connecting the lift unit to a motorized trolley that moves along the tracks or directly attaching the lift to the tracks using a specialized mounting bracket.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Transfer Process:</i></span>To transfer the patient using the overhead track system, Physiotherapists carefully position the patient onto the sling while ensuring their comfort and safety. The lifting device is then activated to raise the patient off the bed or chair, and they are gently moved along the training tracks.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Monitoring and Support:</i></span>Throughout the transfer process, the physiotherapist closely monitors the patient's comfort and stability. They may provide additional support or adjustments as needed to ensure a smooth and safe transfer.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Disconnection and Storage:</i></span> Once the transfer is complete, the lifting device is disconnected from the overhead track system, and any slings or accessories are properly stored. The overhead track system remains in place for future use as needed.</li>
            </ol><br>Overall, implementing an overhead track system for a patient involves careful planning, selection of appropriate equipment, and skilled execution by trained physiotherapists to ensure safe and comfortable transfers.

          <div class="faq-answer">As with any intervention, there may be contraindications for using the overhead track system, including:
            <ol>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Severe respiratory conditions</i></span>such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or severe asthma, may have difficulty tolerating the pressure or positioning required during transfers using overhead track systems.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Unstable cardiovascular</i></span>conditions, such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent heart attack, or severe arrhythmias, may be at increased risk of complications during transfers using overhead track systems.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Unhealed surgical wounds</i></span>incisions, or injuries may be at risk of further injury or complications if subjected to the pressure or friction associated with transfers using overhead track systems.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Unstable fractures</i></span>orthopedic injuries, or recent joint replacements may require specialized handling and precautions during transfers.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Uncontrolled seizure</i></span>disorders may be at risk of injury during transfers using overhead track systems, particularly if a seizure occurs while suspended in the lifting device.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Severe cognitive impairment</i></span>such as advanced dementia or delirium, may have difficulty understanding or cooperating during transfers using overhead track systems.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Unable to maintain stable</i></span>positioning or control their movements may not be suitable candidates for transfers using overhead track systems. This includes individuals with severe spasms, tremors, or involuntary movements that could compromise their safety during transfers.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Uncontrolled pain</i></span>especially during movement or transfers, may make the use of overhead track systems uncomfortable or intolerable.</li>
