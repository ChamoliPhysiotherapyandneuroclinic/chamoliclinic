          <div class="faq-question" id="sign">What Are The Different Types Of Advanced Physiotherapies?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">There are several advanced physiotherapy techniques that can be used to manage pain, improve mobility, and promote healing. Here are some of the most common techniques and a brief explanation of how they work: <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Shockwave therapy: </i></span>This modality involves the use of high-frequency sound waves to treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions, including plantar fasciitis, tennis elbow, and shoulder pain.

It is commonly used to treat herniated discs, sciatica, and other conditions that cause back pain. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES):</i></span>This modality involves the use of electrical impulses to stimulate the muscles and nerves, promoting muscle strength and reducing pain and inflammation. It is commonly used to treat conditions such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and spinal cord injuries. <br>

It can include massage, stretching, and joint mobilization techniques, and is often used to reduce pain and improve range of motion. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Dry needling: </i></span>This technique involves the insertion of fine needles into trigger points or tight muscles to release tension and reduce pain. It is similar to acupuncture but is based on Western anatomy and physiology. <br>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question" id="measure">How Can A Physiotherapist Determine Which Advanced Technique Is Appropriate For A Particular Individual Or Condition?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">A physiotherapist will typically begin by conducting a thorough assessment of the individual's condition, including their medical history, symptoms, and any previous treatments or therapies. Based on this information, they can then develop a personalized treatment plan that may include one or more advanced physiotherapy techniques, as well as other complementary therapies or interventions. <br>
            When an individual suffers from a long-term painful condition and doesn't find benefits from any prior treatments then he can be advised to use advanced techniques that not just help in pain relief but also help to improve the condition by supporting the structures, promoting the healing process, and thereby improving the quality of life of an individual.
