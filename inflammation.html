          <div class="faq-question" id="spasm">Inflammation</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Inflammation is a natural defense mechanism of the body in response to injury, infection, or other harmful stimuli. It is a complex biological process involving the immune system, blood vessels, and various cells and molecules. The purpose of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out damaged tissue, and initiate healing.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question" id="cause">Causes of Neck Pain</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">The causes of inflammation can be broadly classified into two types: acute and chronic inflammation.
            <ul>
                <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Acute inflammation:</i></span> This type of inflammation occurs in response to short-term injuries or infections. It is characterized by a rapid onset and short duration. Common causes include infections (e.g., bacterial, viral), physical injuries, burns, and chemical irritants.</li>
                <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Chronic inflammation:</i></span> Unlike acute inflammation, chronic inflammation persists over a longer period, often for months or years. It is typically associated with conditions such as autoimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus), chronic infections, prolonged exposure to certain irritants (e.g., tobacco smoke), or inappropriate immune response.</li>
            </ul>
            Inflammation is a crucial part of the body's defense and healing mechanisms. However, if it becomes chronic or uncontrolled, it can contribute to various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, certain types of cancer, and autoimmune disorders. Therefore, it's important to manage inflammation appropriately through medical intervention when necessary.
