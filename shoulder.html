          <div class="faq-question" id="spasm">Shoulder Pain</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Shoulder pain refers to any discomfort, ache, or pain that is experienced in the shoulder region. The shoulder 
            is a complex joint that provides a wide range of motion, allowing you to perform various activities such as lifting, throwing, and 
            reaching. However, due to its complexity and the involvement of multiple structures, the shoulder is susceptible to various injuries 
            and conditions that can cause pain.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question" id="cause">Causes of Shoulder Pain</div>
          <div class="faq-answer"><span><i class="text-highlight">Rotator cuff injuries:</i></span>A rotator cuff is a group of muscles and 
            tendons that surround the shoulder joint and help stabilize it. Injuries to the rotator cuff, such as tears or strains, can result 
            in shoulder pain and limited range of motion.<br><span><i class="text-highlight">Shoulder impingement: </i></span> This occurs when 
            the tendons of the rotator cuff and the bursa (a fluid-filled sac that cushions the tendons) get compressed or pinched between the 
            bones of the shoulder. It can cause pain, especially when lifting the arm or performing overhead activities.<br><span>
            <i class="text-highlight">Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis):</i></span>This condition involves the thickening and tightening of 
            the shoulder capsule, which restricts movement and causes pain. It often develops gradually and can severely limit shoulder mobility. 
            <br><span><i class="text-highlight">Shoulder Arthritis:</i></span>Arthritis is the inflammation of joints, and when it affects the 
            shoulder, it can cause pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion.<br><span><i class="text-highlight">Shoulder dislocation:</i>
            </span>This occurs when the upper arm bone (humerus) pops out of the shoulder socket. It can cause intense pain and instability in 
            the shoulder. <br><span><i class="text-highlight">Tendinitis: </i></span> Inflammation of the tendons in the shoulder, such as biceps 
            tendinitis or supraspinatus tendinitis, can lead to shoulder pain, especially during specific movements.<br><span><i class="text-highlight">
            Shoulder instability:</i></span>Instability occurs when the structures that hold the shoulder joint together, such as ligaments or the 
            labrum, are damaged or weakened. This can cause the shoulder to feel loose or "pop out" of place, resulting in pain and instability.
            <br><span><i class="text-highlight">Bursitis:</i></span>Bursae are small, fluid-filled sacs that reduce friction between bones, 
            tendons, and muscles. Inflamed or irritated bursae can cause shoulder pain, commonly known as bursitis.<br><span><i class="text-highlight">
            Shoulder fractures: </i></span>Fractures or broken bones in the shoulder, such as a clavicle (collarbone) fracture or a proximal humerus 
            fracture, can lead to significant pain and difficulty moving the shoulder.<br><span><i class="text-highlight">Referred pain: </i></span>
            Sometimes, pain originating from other areas, such as the neck, upper back, or organs like the gallbladder, can be felt in the shoulder. 
            This is known as referred pain.

            arthritis, rotator cuff tears, and degenerative changes are more common in older adults.<br><span><i class="text-highlight">Poor posture:
            </i></span>Slouching or maintaining poor posture over time can contribute to muscle imbalances and strain on the shoulder, leading to 
            pain and discomfort.<br> <span><i class="text-highlight">Overuse or repetitive activities: </i></span>Engaging in repetitive shoulder 
            movements or activities that place excessive stress on the shoulder joint, such as lifting heavy objects or participating in certain 
            sports, can increase the risk of developing shoulder pain.<br><span><i class="text-highlight">Lack of physical conditioning:</i></span>
            Insufficient strength and flexibility in the muscles surrounding the shoulder joint can make the shoulder more prone to injuries and 
            pain.<br><Span><i class="text-highlight">Previous shoulder injuries:</i></Span>Individuals who have previously experienced shoulder 
            injuries, such as dislocations, fractures, or rotator cuff tears, may be at a higher risk of developing ongoing shoulder pain or 
            reinjuring the shoulder.<br> <span><i class="text-highlight">Certain sports or occupations:</i></span>Participating in sports or occupations 
            that involve repetitive overhead movements or heavy lifting, such as baseball, swimming, construction work, or painting, can increase the 
            risk of shoulder pain. <br><span><i class="text-highlight">Poor lifting techniques:</i></span>Lifting objects with improper techniques, 
            such as using the shoulder instead of the legs or back, can strain the shoulder muscles and lead to pain. <br><span><i class="text-highlight">
            Genetic factors: </i></span>Certain genetic factors may contribute to an increased risk of developing shoulder conditions like shoulder 
            instability or specific types of arthritis. <br><span><i class="text-highlight">Systemic diseases: </i></span>Some systemic conditions, 
            such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and thyroid disorders, can increase the risk of developing shoulder pain and related conditions. 
            <br><span><i class="text-highlight">Smoking: </i></span>Smoking has been associated with an increased risk of developing shoulder pain and 
            delayed healing of shoulder injuries.

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question" id="treat">Treatment Overview</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">The treatment for shoulder pain depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. 
            Here are some common treatment approaches: <br><span><i class="text-highlight">Pain management: </i></span>Over-the-
            counter pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can help reduce pain and inflammation. 
            Your healthcare provider may prescribe stronger pain medications if necessary. In some cases, corticosteroid injections 
            may be used to provide temporary relief from pain and inflammation. <br><span><i class="text-highlight">Surgical 
            intervention: </i></span>If conservative treatments do not adequately relieve the shoulder pain or if there is a 
            significant structural problem, surgical intervention may be necessary. The specific type of surgery will depend on the 
            underlying condition, and it may involve repairing a torn tendon, stabilizing the joint, or replacing the joint in cases 
            of severe arthritis.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question" id="diagnosis"> Physiotherapy Treatment for Neck Pain</div>
          <div class="faq-answer"><span><i class="text-highlight">Rest and activity modification:</i></span>Resting the shoulder and avoiding 
            activities that aggravate the pain is often the first step in treatment. Depending on the cause of the pain, your physiotherapist 
            may recommend specific modifications to your daily activities or sports to allow the shoulder to heal.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Hot and cold therapy:</i></span>Applying heat or cold to the affected shoulder can help reduce pain and inflammation. Cold packs are 
            typically used in the acute phase of an injury, while heat therapy is beneficial for chronic conditions.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Assistive devices:</i></span>In certain cases, using assistive devices such as slings, braces, or splints may be recommended to immobilize 
            the shoulder, provide support, or protect it during the healing process. These devices help relieve stress on the shoulder joint and promote 
            recovery.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Lifestyle modifications:</i></span>Making certain lifestyle modifications can also contribute to 
            managing and preventing shoulder pain. This may include maintaining a healthy weight, improving posture, and avoiding repetitive overhead 
            activities or movements that can strain the shoulder.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS):</i></span>TENS therapy involves the use of a device that delivers low-voltage electrical 
            currents through electrodes placed on the skin near the painful area. The electrical stimulation helps to block pain signals, stimulate the release of endorphins (natural 
            pain-relieving chemicals), and promote circulation. TENS can be used as a non-invasive, drug-free method to relieve shoulder pain.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">EMS, also known as neuromuscular electrical stimulation, involves the use of electrical currents to stimulate muscle contractions. It is often 
            used to strengthen weak or injured muscles around the shoulder joint. EMS can help improve muscle strength, increase blood flow, reduce muscle spasms, and enhance muscle recruitment 
            and coordination.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Interferential Current (IFC) Therapy:</i></span>IFC therapy involves the use of two medium-frequency electrical currents that intersect and produce a 
            low-frequency current within the body. The intersecting currents create a deeper and more comfortable penetration of the electrical stimulation. IFC therapy helps to relieve pain, 
            reduce inflammation, and improve circulation. It is commonly used for shoulder pain caused by conditions like tendinitis, bursitis, or muscle strains.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Ultrasound Therapy:</i></span>Ultrasound therapy utilizes high-frequency sound waves to generate deep heat within the tissues. It can help increase 
            blood flow, promote tissue healing, reduce inflammation, and alleviate pain in the shoulder. Ultrasound therapy is often used in combination with other treatments, such as physiotherapy, 
            to enhance their effectiveness.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Laser Therapy:</i></span>Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) or cold laser therapy involves the use of low-intensity lasers to stimulate cellular activity and 
            promote tissue healing. Laser therapy can help reduce pain and inflammation, improve blood flow, and enhance tissue repair in the shoulder. It is a non-invasive and painless treatment option. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Therapeutic Exercises:</i></span>A physiotherapist will prescribe specific exercises to improve the strength, flexibility, and stability of the muscles and joints 
            surrounding the shoulder. These exercises may include range-of-motion exercises, stretching exercises, strengthening exercises targeting the rotator cuff muscles and scapular stabilizers, and 
            functional exercises to improve shoulder movement patterns. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Manual Therapy:</i></span>Manual therapy techniques involve hands-on interventions performed by a physiotherapist. These techniques may include joint mobilizations, 
            soft tissue mobilizations, myofascial release, trigger point therapy, and other specialized techniques to reduce pain, improve joint mobility, and address muscle imbalances or restrictions in the 
            shoulder and surrounding areas. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Posture Correction and Body Mechanics Training:</i></span>A physiotherapist can provide guidance on improving posture and body mechanics during daily activities to 
            reduce stress and strain on the shoulder joint. They can teach proper techniques for lifting, carrying, and reaching to minimize the risk of further shoulder pain. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Functional Rehabilitation:</i></span>Physiotherapists focus not only on reducing pain but also on restoring your ability to perform functional activities. 
            They can provide specific exercises and activities tailored to your work, sports, or daily life demands to help you regain optimal shoulder function and return to your normal activities. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Education and Self-Management Strategies:</i></span>Physiotherapists play a crucial role in educating you about your condition, teaching you self-management strategies,
             and providing ergonomic advice to prevent future shoulder problems. They can guide you on home exercises, proper body mechanics, and activity modifications to manage your shoulder pain effectively.
