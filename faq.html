            for better results. Apart from this, a senior physio is also available at the clinic <br> who can keep an eye on the undergoing treatment. But 
            if a patient wants treatment to be done at their home & <br>treatment requires only manual therapy or portable instruments, we can provide home 
            care physiotherapy. Normally <br> for long-term treatments, if you are not sure whether you can visit the clinic regularly, you should opt for a

            the treatment plan with you. This may include advice regarding the approximate number of sessions you may require. <br>
            Our Expert will also discuss the frequency of the session. A patient can take treatment sessions on a daily basis or on <br>
            an alternate basis if skipping sessions in between doesn’t harm the treatment process.</div>
