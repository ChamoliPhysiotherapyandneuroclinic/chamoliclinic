          <div class="faq-question" id="spasm">Neck Pain</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Neck pain, also known as cervicalgia, is a common problem, with two-thirds of the population having neck 
            pain at some point in their lives .Neck pain, although felt in the neck, can be caused by numerous other spinal problems. Neck 
            pain may arise due to muscular tightness in both the neck and upper back, and pinching of the nerves emanating from the cervical 
            vertebrae. Joint disruption in the neck creates pain, as does joint disruption in the upper back. The bones, ligaments, and 
            muscles of your neck support your head and allow for motion. Any abnormalities, inflammation, or injury can cause neck pain or 
            stiffness Many people experience neck pain or stiffness occasionally.

          <div class="faq-question" id="sign">Risk Factors That Are Associated With Neck Pain</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Understanding risk factors can help identify high-risk patients and improve their neck pain management. 
            Since older adults usually face both age-related physical and psychosocial issues, comprehensive assessments and treatments are 
            needed to effectively manage neck pain. Some common risk factor considering back pain management are as:<br> 
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Age:</i></span>Neck pain is more common as you get older, starting around age 30 or 40.<br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Poor posture:</i></span> Working at a desk for too long without changing position can often lead 
            to neck pain.<br> <span><i class="text-highlight">Diseases:</i></span>Some types of arthritis and cancer can contribute to neck pain.
            <br><span><i class="text-highlight"> Sudden jerks</i></span> Sudden jerks to your neck while doing some exercise can be one the 
            contributing factors for you neck pain.<br><Span><i class="text-highlight">Sleeping postures</i></Span>People having awkward sleeping 
            postures are prone to have a greater risk of back pain. <br> <span><i class="text-highlight">Smoking:</i></span>Smokers have increased 
            rates of neck pain. This may occur because smoking prompts more coughing, which can lead to herniated disks. Smoking can also decrease 
            blood flow to the spine and increase the risk of osteoporosis.

          <div class="faq-question" id="measure">Preventive Measures For Avoiding Neck Pain</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Most neck pain is associated with poor posture combined with age-related wear and tear. To help prevent neck pain, 
            keep your head cantered over your spine. Some simple changes in your daily routine may help. Consider trying to:
            <ul>
                <li>Use good posture. When standing and sitting, be sure your shoulders are in a straight line over your hips and your ears are directly 
                    over your shoulders.</li>
                <li>Take frequent breaks. If you travel long distances or work long hours at your computer, get up, move around and stretch your neck and 
                    shoulders.</li>
                <li>Adjust your desk, chair and computer so that the monitor is at eye level. Knees should be slightly lower than hips. Use your chair's 
                    armrests.</li>
                <li> Avoid tucking the phone between your ear and shoulder when you talk. Use a headset or speakerphone instead.</li>
                <li>If you smoke, quit. Smoking can put you at higher risk of developing neck pain.</li>
                <li>Avoid carrying heavy bags with straps over your shoulder. The weight can strain your neck.</li>
            </ul>
            Sleep in a good position. Your head and neck should be aligned with your body. Use a small pillow under your neck. Try sleeping on your back 
            with your thighs elevated on pillows, which will flatten your spinal muscles.

          <div class="faq-question" id="seek">When To Seek Medical Help? </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Most neck pain improves gradually with home treatment. If not, see your doctor. Seek immediate care if severe neck pain 
            results from an injury, such as a motor vehicle accident, diving accident or fall. You should also see a doctor if you have:
            <ul>
                <li>severe neck pain without apparent cause</li>

          <div class="faq-question" id="treat">Treatment Overview</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">You doctor will perform a physical exam and take your complete medical history. Be prepared to tell your doctor 
            about the specifics of your symptoms. You should also let them know about all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications and 
            supplements you’ve been taking. Even if it doesn’t seem related, you should also let your doctor know about any recent injuries or 
            accidents you’ve had. Treatment for neck pain depends on the diagnosis. In addition to a thorough history and physical exam by your 
            doctor, you may also need one or more of the following imaging studies and tests to help your doctor determine the cause of your neck 
            pain:

                <li>Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)</li>
            </ul>
