          <div class="faq-question" id="stiff">What is Muscle Stiffness?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Muscle stiffness is when your muscles feel tight and you find it more difficult 
            to move than you usually do, especially after rest. You may also have muscle pains, cramping, and discomfort. 
            This is different from muscle rigidity and spasticity. With these two symptoms, your muscles stay stiff even 
            when you’re not moving. Muscle stiffness usually goes away on its own. You may find relief with regular exercise 
            and  stretching. In some cases, muscle stiffness can be a sign of something more serious, especially if there are
            other symptoms present. Muscles stiffness can also be accompanied by pain, cramping, and discomfort.It is usually 
            not a cause for concern and can be treated with home remedies and stretching.</p></div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question" id="cause">Cause of Muscle Stiffness</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Muscle stiffness typically occurs after exercise, hard physical work, or lifting weights. You 
            may also feel stiffness after periods of inactivity, like when you get out of bed in the morning or get out of a chair 
            after sitting for a long time. Sprains and strains are the most common reasons for muscle stiffness.
            <ul>
              <li>Sprains and Strains</li>
              <li>Polymyalgia rheumatica causes muscle pain and stiffness. It usually affects the upper body, including the shoulders, 
                neck, and arms. It also commonly affects the hips. The average age of a person with polymyalgia rheumatica is 70, and 
                some people do not develop it until they reach their 80s.</li>
              <li>Chronic fatigue Syndrome</li>
              <li>Fibromyalgia</li>
            </ul>
            Other common conditions that may cause stiff muscles include:
            <ul>
              <li>Insect bite or sting</li>
              <li>Infection</li>
              <li>Injury from extreme heat or cold</li>
              <li>Anaesthesia or medication used for surgery</li>
            </ul>       
            Some symptoms can be treated at home. Make an appointment with your doctor if your sprain or strain causes severe pain or if 
            any additional symptoms don’t go away. Stiff muscles with other symptoms may mean an underlying condition.

            symptoms.Tetanusisa bacterial infection, usually from soil or dirt, with symptoms that include:

            examination to locate your pain or stiffness. And your doctor may order blood or other lab tests, including X-rays and CT or MRI scans.
            <br>Your specific treatment will vary depending on the cause. Your doctor may recommend anti-inflammatory medications, like ibuprofen, to lessen pain and 
            discomfort.

            You may be able to treat muscle stiffness at home with rest, massage, and application of heat or cold.

            therapy patches.
            Apply heat or cold to the affected area for no more than 20 minutes. Let the area rest for 20 minutes before reapplying either option. If you aren’t sure 
            about whether to use heat or cold, call your doctor for instructions.
            <br><span><i class="text-highlight">Stretches:</i></span>
