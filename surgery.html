          <div class="faq-question" id="spasm">What is Pre And Post Surgery Rehabilitation?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer"><span><i class="text-highlight">Pre-Surgery Rehabilitation</i></span>Pre-surgery rehabilitation allows patients to prepare for and recuperate from surgery safely under the supervision of a physical therapist. Physical therapy prior to surgery helps reduce pain and inflammation. It improves joint mobility and range of motion to prepare clients for a more successful surgical outcome. Pre-surgical rehabilitation is an individualized exercise conditioning program that trains the muscles in advance for the exercises they will need to do post-surgery. Pre-surgical rehabilitation helps patients to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, increase stamina, enhance overall fitness, restore range of motion and regain strength and flexibility in the joints and muscles near the injured area. Pre-surgical physical therapy leads to faster recovery with better outcomes. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Post-Surgery Rehabilitation</i></span>Post-surgical rehabilitation is crucial to regaining pain-free function and returning to daily activities safely and more quickly. Post-operative physical therapy safely eases patients back into daily activity and regular exercise. Our physical therapists perform a thorough evaluation post-surgery and develop a customized treatment plan to minimize adverse effects from surgery and restore normal movement, flexibility, and function. Post-surgery rehabilitation helps patients to manage post-operative pain, regain motion and strength, decrease pain, stiffness, and swelling and return to their daily activities more quickly. Post-surgical rehabilitation can take several months and it is essential to begin physical therapy shortly after surgery so that the joint can heal properly and minimize scar tissue development. Physical therapy following surgery will lead to a faster recovery.

          <div class="faq-question" id="cause">How Does It Work?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer"><span><i class="text-highlight">Pre-surgical Rehabilitation:</i></span>This involves conditioning the body through exercise. This step is just as important as rehabilitation after surgery. For instance, studies indicate that the knee’s functional ability post-surgery depends on its functional ability before the procedure. <br>
            Improving your strength and now can result in better outcomes after surgery. Some programs can help shorten the length of your hospital stay and reduce the need for post-operative rehabilitation. Your physical therapist will focus on several areas, including your strength, balance, flexibility, joint stability, cardiovascular fitness, and range of motion. Most pre-operative rehabilitation programs last four to six weeks depending on your needs. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Post-surgical Rehabilitation:</i></span>After surgery, the physiotherapist will show you how to get on and off a chair, use assistive devices, and improve your mobility. Your physiotherapist will teach you pain management strategies and create an exercise plan for faster recovery. Post-operative physical therapy can be a crucial part of returning back to your normal activity. <br>
              A skilled therapist can help reduce the side effects of surgery, such as pain and inflammation. We are happy to assist patients before and after ligament repair, arthroscopy, decompressions, tendon transfers, total joint replacements, and ACL repairs. Our programs can decrease the risk of complications and help you achieve a full range of motion.

          <div class="faq-question" id="measure">Who Will Benefit?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Pre and Post-surgical rehab is often recommended for those having orthopedic surgery. The following are several important benefits of having pre and post-surgical rehab. Physical therapy treatment can help you achieve as much strength, stamina, flexibility, and improved range of motion as possible both before and after your surgery. A physical therapist may use a variety of manual therapies or teach you exercises you can do at home. A therapist might also use heat, ice, or electrical stimulation. <br>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Benefits of Pre-Surgical Rehab</i></span> <br>This is often called pre-rehabilitation, and it helps an individual prepare physically and mentally for a surgical procedure. There are several benefits of going to rehab before your surgery. <br>
            <ul>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Faster Recovery– </i></span>Learning the exercises you’ll need to do before surgery trains your muscles in advance. This will make post-surgical rehab easier and more effective.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Fewer Complications–</i></span>The weaker and frailer an individual is, the more likely it is that the person will experience complications such as infection after a surgical procedure. Pre-rehab can increase strength and immunity prior to surgery.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Less Anxiety–</i></span>Patients that have undergone some sort of pre-rehab are often less prone to anxiety or stress prior to the surgery. Starting a process of physical activity that improves strength, endurance, and flexibility can improve overall confidence that the procedure will be successful.</li>
            </ul>
            <span><i class="text-highlight">Benefits of Post-Surgical Rehab</i></span><br>It’s important to start a post-surgical rehabilitation plan as soon as your doctor states that you’re ready. The following are a few of the benefits of post-surgical rehab. <br>
            <ul>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Improve Circulation– </i></span>Improved circulation not only facilitates faster healing but reduces the chance of a blood clot forming. Something as simple as massage can improve circulation. Many types of basic exercises and simple movements prescribed by a physical therapist can promote increased blood circulation.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Reduce Pain and Swelling–</i></span>The right type of post-surgical treatment can help reduce the amount of pain and swelling you experience after your surgery. Icing and ultrasound are both techniques a physical therapist may use to reduce localized swelling and pain. According to PT in Motion News, patients that received the same day, post-operative physical therapy needed fewer opioids after knee surgery.</li>
              <li><span><i class="text-highlight">Regain Lost Strength–</i></span>The more quickly you regain strength and stamina, the more quickly you’ll get back to your daily routine. A physical therapy program can be designed to target the specific areas in your body that need strengthening after surgery.</li>
